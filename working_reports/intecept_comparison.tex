\subsubsection*{Intercept comparisons}

Logically, zero of some counting characteristic, be it zero jobs or zero people or whatever, will result in zero ridership. Thus, there may be some value in removing the intercept from the various regression methods.

For two regression types, Poisson with identity link and linear least squares, here is a comparison of regression both with and without intercepts. The addition of features occurs in the same way as the last regression analysis. The data has been modified somewhat as the 60net characteristics are removed.

Least squares regression is not very much different depending on whether an intercept has been added. Poisson regression with no intercept, on the other hand, does not work very well.
